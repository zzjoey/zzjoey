## Sitting at the intersection of **technology and business**, focus on building great **products**.

I graduated from **Carnegie Mellon University** major in Software Engineering, and have spent years as a developer, including four years studying, working, and living in **Silicon Valley**. My past experience includes engineering roles at companies such as **Bilibili**, **Tesla**, and **Google**.

I'm also a **serial startup founder**, having built teams, technology, and product from 0→1, and led fundraising. My most recent company was accepted into one of the **world’s most selective accelerators** (acceptance rate < 0.1%, ~35 out of 35,000+ per year).

### Tech

I served at 2 startups as Co-Founder / CTO. My tech skills including Frontend: React, Next.js, Mobile: React Native, Swift, Backend: Go, Python, Architecture: Microservices, Distributed Systems, AI: LLMs, RAG, LangGraph, Agentic Systems, Context Engineering, etc. 

My experience ranges from building focused, vertical AI RAG systems to designing and architecturing large-scale distributed systems serving over 200 million DAU (daily active user).

### Business

Through my startup journey, I've become increasingly interested in the philosophy behind **product, business, and humanity**. As [Steve Jobs said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlI1MR-qNt8), *“It’s technology married with liberal arts and married with the humanities that yields results that make our hearts sing.”*

I also read a lot from [Paul Graham's blog](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), a few essays I can resonate like [You Weren't Meant to Have a Boss](https://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [How to Do Great Work](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html), [Founder Mode](https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html). In my point of view, sucess can be break down into **philosophy** and **methods**, and there's a clear path linking both.

### My Equation

For a company: **Success = Team + Product + Customers + Funding + (Luck) = Revenue + Impact**  
For a human: **Success = Determination + Resilient + Discernment + Execution + (Luck) = Achievements + Happiness**

I’m still learning - and exploring - what it truly takes to build a great company, and a great life.
